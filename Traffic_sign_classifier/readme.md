Traffic_sign_classifier

In this project, I use what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, I then try out my model on images of German traffic signs that I find on the web using Google.
