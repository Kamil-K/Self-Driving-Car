<b>Extended Kalman Filter Project</b>

<i>Purpose:</i> I implement the extended Kalman filter in C++. It is based on the simulated lidar and radar measurements detecting a bicycle that travels around a vehicle. I use a Kalman filter, lidar measurements and radar measurements to track the bicycle's position and velocity.

<i>Resources:</i> I use https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project as a starting point for this project as well as a Term 2 Simulator from Udacity Self Driving Car NanoDegree program.

<i>Note:</i> This project is completed as a part of the Udacity Self Driving Car NanoDegree program.

Starter code is located in the /src directory with the main file is main.cpp.

Pictures of the calculater RMSE error are located in the /RMSE_Screenshots folder.
