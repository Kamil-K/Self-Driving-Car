LaneLines Project

In this project, I write code to identify lane lines on the road, first in an image, and later in a video stream (really just a series of images). My first goal is to write code including a series of steps (pipeline) that identify and draw the lane lines on a few test images. I then refine my pipeline with parameter tuning and by averaging and extrapolating the lines. Finally, I make a brief writeup report. Have a look at the video clips called "white.mp4" and "yellow.mp4" in the repository to see examples of what my final output looks like.
