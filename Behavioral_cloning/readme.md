Behavioral_cloning Project

In this project, I use what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. I train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model outputs a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

Special simulator was used from Udacity where I can steer a car around a track for data collection. I use image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.
